# A List of Our Repositories

1. Create a new file called `<my-name>-repo.md`
2. Open that file and make a markdown link to your Github Repository
3. Add any other information you're comfortable in sharing (just to have the exercise of writing in markdown.)
4. `git add .`
5. `git commit -m "my contribution"`
6. `git push -u origin master`
